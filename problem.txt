conclusion: standard output

A little girl is learning to reduce the number of accruals, but she does it wrong with multi-digit numbers. Tanya calculates units of measurement according to the following algorithm:

    if the last digit was calculated unequal,
    if the last digit is significant, it divides the number by 10.

You are given an integer n
. Tanya wants to subtract from thousands of units at a time. Your task is to get the result after all k

subtractions.

It is guaranteed that the answer will be a multi-digit number.

Input data:

The first line of the input contains two integers n
and k (2≤n≤109, 1≤k≤50) is the number from which Tanya wants to subtract one and the number of subtractions, respectively.

Output:

Print one integer — the result of subtraction from n k units once.

It is guaranteed that the answer will be a positive integer.

Example

Input data:
512 4

Output:
50
